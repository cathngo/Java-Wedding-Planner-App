# Usability Summary
With the context of our application being a front facing program, the users' interactions with the application was at the core of its design to enhance their relationship with the system and maintain an overall user satisfaction. To achieve such results our GUI application prioritised the UX and UI design of our application to ensure that **Nielson’s Ten Heuristics** of design are followed.

## Nielson’s (1994) heuristics
| Heuristic |  Application |
|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status (Feedback)| -	Utilisation of red inline error messages at login screen <br/>-	Popup error messages for various cases such as: <br/>-->Attempting to view the details of an Item without selecting It from the table <br/> -->Attempting to create an Item without filling out required contents <br/>  -->Attempting to create Items which already exist <br/>Buttons provide feedback when interacted with:<br/>   -->Darken in colour when hovered over <br/>-->Mouse cursor changes to hand when hovering over clickable object<br/>    -->Font bolded when clicked on |
| User control and freedom  |  -Users can navigate to any of the previous pages by selecting the page name from the breadcrumb<br/>-Users may navigate to a different page at any time by selecting the page from the side bar <br/>-	Users are also able to navigate through navigation buttons <br/>-Users are able to close or minimise application when desired<br/>-Users able to remove a guest from a guest list, providing control over their actions |
| Flexibility and efficiency of use  | -	Ease of use is addressed by the consistency of design<br/>-	Use of labels and breadcrumbs to support the user in navigation <br/>Navigation panel offers quick access to different application functions from any page in the app|
| Help and documentation |  -	Utilised at the login screen where users have the ability to select “forgot password” if they have forgotten their login credentials<br/>-	The about page also outlines documentation in regard to the systems design references, providing an entire page which collates all referencing documentation|
| Match between system and the real world  | -	Sidebar follows a top to bottom layout whereby primary functionalities are positioned at the top of the toolbar<br/>-	Also implemented in the design of forms e.g. login page, it is naturally intuitive that before a user can provide a password, they must first provide a username which creaes a natural, intuitive design<br/>-	Layout of the tables - <br/>Icons on navigation panel provide familiar visual aids for easy identification|
| Error prevention | -	  Use of radio buttons to fixate the available options that the user can select ensures correct values are entered into the system  |
| Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors |-	 Inline Error messages create a visual aid to immediately enable the user to perceive the error that is occured<br/>-	 Popup error messages accurately indicate the problem occured, so that users can take the correct actions accordingly.|
| Consistency and standards  | -	Each page of the application follows a similar layout that includes a table with an overview of necessary information followed by labelled buttons<br/>-	The buttons are consistently situated at the bottom of the pages<br/>-	Each page has a Page header and a breadcrumb bar<br/>-	 Consistent use of font across application, runsheet, and invitations<br/>-Button shape and size standardised |
| Recognition rather than recall  | -	The consistency of design and ease of use of our application ensures users are able to easily recall features for quick navigation.<br/>-	Labelled buttons allow user to easily familiarise themselves with the system<br/>-	Consistent layout and position of buttons and tables ensures intuitive functionality|
| Aesthetic and minimalist design | -	Follows a simple colour scheme consisting of Green, Grey and White<br/>-	Utilisation of whitespace to reduce clutter provides a visually appealing aesthetic<br/>-	Use of simple vector images|
