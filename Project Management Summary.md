# PROJECT MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

## What is this?
A document briefly outlining how your team managed the progression of tasks and the sharing of source code. You may wish to draw on concepts such as Scrum1. You should describe how your team used version control such as Git. 

## Version Control
In developing our INVO Event Planning Application, Github was the primary tool used for sharing code. The ability to view version history and keep track of all the files we have committed proved to be highly useful. Using Github also encouraged us to communicate thoroughly, making sure to always push new changes and pull updates regularly. Commit history also allowed us to see at a glance what other team members had worked on recently, and track overall progresssion of our project. An issue with Github however was that it does not easily allow the quick sharing of code to be rapidly changed or updated. To resolve this issue our team made frequent use of the website **https://codeshare.io/** , which allowed us to share snippets of code in real time for viewing and troubleshooting. 

## Task Progression and Allocation
In the initial planning stage of this project, our team realised the variety of tasks and skills that needed in order to build a fully functional application. We applied an agile mindset to the allocation and progression of tasks, by having team members specialise in different aspects of the work. These categories of tasks included GUI (designing and creating FXML files), writing controllers, database work, PDF editing, and creating methods that could be used across different functions. By specialising in certain features, we were hence able to immerse ourselves in learning and familiarising ourselves with a specific task, complete similar tasks quickly, and teach our fellow group members our learnings.

We started off the project with a good deal of planning, in particular familisarising ourselves with the use of Github, Netbeans and SceneBuilder. Next, we progressed to designing and creating handdrawn wireframes for what our application pages would look like, ensuring that we would be covering all the required functionalities for our app. From these wireframes we created a full, collated view of our screens using the wireframe collaboration platform **Figma**. The link to our wireframes can be found here: **https://www.figma.com/file/Oc2aRLqGVFbHd60Z9AV1Wl/Event-Sharing-Code?node-id=0%3A1**

Once wireframes were completed, our team applied scrum principles by iteratively and incrementally building various working functionalities that we would piece together intoo our final app. Google Spreadsheets was used to keep track of completed work, work in progress, and tasks left to do, as well as for sharing important code that would be needed across various pages. Roadblocks, issues, and bugs that we encountered along the way were openly shared with the rest of the team so that each team member always had something to work on. 

**Communication**
With the occcurence of the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic, our team was only able to meet once in person to discuss our project in the early stages. Fortunately however, the pandemic also meant that we had more time at home to spend on this project and complete it to our best ability. Because we were always home, it also meant that scheduling regular calls to update each other about our work was also relatively easy. Our team had biweekly stand-up like calls to update each other on our progress, and let each other know what we had done, what we were working on, and any problems we've encountered.
